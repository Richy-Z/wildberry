# üçì Wildberry

This project is an interpreter for the Little Man Computer (LMC) instruction set in Lua. It is intended for fun and educational purposes.

The reason I have called it Wildberry (for now) instead of something like LMC, is because I plan to write a few extensions to the LMC instruction set so that it becomes less of a pain to use. In that case, it would become the Wildberry Instruction Set (inspired a bit by LMC), but we will see.
